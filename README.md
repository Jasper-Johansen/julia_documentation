# Julia Documentation Project

Welcome to the Julia Documentation Project!

This repository is dedicated to exploring front-end development techniques, including:

- Internal referencing with HTML tags
- Navigation menus using `<nav>` elements
- Responsive design with @media queries
- Advanced CSS styling

Join us as we test and enhance these concepts to create a robust documentation experience. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!
